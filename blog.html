    <h1>2 May 2023: New School Policy</h1>
    <p>The new school policy is absolute garbage. The school is enforcing us to use their school issued chromebooks next year, however, their chromebooks suck and are like fifty year old and hard to use. Most studets bring their own personal devices to school instead of the school chromebooks because everyone favors their own laptop of the crusty musty school ones, which by the way are extremely slow and hard to use. Why not let the students choose what to use, as it is their own education and schooling. Forcing them to use these crap chromebooks, lowers their level of recieved education, as it is not up to date with the best technology. Obviously providing kids with chromebooks seems like a good idea, but forcing kids to use this terrible piece of crap is stupid, and will most definetely slow the netwroks down, especially since this network was crap and everyone will now be using it, it will be extremely slow and an awful idea.</p>
