      <h1>2022 ISP</h1>
      <p>This was my ISP last school year called Lavocado Run. If the avocado got hit, it would die. I am very proud of what our group did like creating a sprite sheet, using sound/music in the background, and making a functional game.The easier parts were getting the characters to move across the screen, while the hardest part was randomizing the carrots, without making the game impossible to play.</p>

	  <h3>Concept</h3>
	  <p>This game is based of of the offline google game with the t-rex. Our concept was to have an avocado jump over carrots and duck under mangos, as shown above.</p>

	<h3>The Game</h3>
	<p>This clip also shows our game in action, and shows the 3 scenes that we had for our game, the beginning (start) scene, the main (game) scene, and the ending scene. We even added a start button and replay button to make the scenes transition.</p>

	<h3>Sprite</h3>
	<p>Shown above is our sprite that I created. It is of our main character, the Avocado Princess. I had to create a sprite sheet with a bunch of different images of the avocado, and I am happy with how it turned out, since this was my first sprite I have created.</p>

	<h3>Code For Sprite</h3>
	<p>To make our sprite run, we used a sprite sheet. To make the running animation in the code above, we had a sourceRect that moved right every four frames, and when it reached the last frame of the sprite sheet, the sourceRect move back to the first frame.</p>

	<h3>Code To Enqeue Scene</h3>
	<p>This snippet is code to enqeue the next scene. It gave us trouble at first, however once we understood it, it was relatively easy. This function enqeues and transition to the next scene, and the function death stops the music.</p>

	<h3>Containment Code</h3>
	<p>This code shows our group using containment to know when the avocaodo touches the mango or carrot. If it does touch, we use the function death and enqeue the next screen. If the avocado doesn't touch either, the game continues.</p>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>Honestly, I'm very happy with how our final game turned out to be. Along the way, I learned so much and the result of this game proves that. As said above, the hardest part of this game had to be randomizing the carrots. At first the carrots would come one at a time, then gradually more and more carrots would come, making the game impossible to play after a certain amount of time, I think we mostly fixed that problem; however, there are still areas we can improve on.
