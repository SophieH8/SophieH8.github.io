	  <h1>Introduction</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="classes-col">
	      <p>During the last few decades, with the rise of various Internet platforms and services, our lives are increasingly made public. With just the search of a name, one can find a plethora of information about a person, from their social media to even private information like phone numbers, personal relations, and even addresses.</p>
	      <p>Similarly, many different platforms utilize algorithms to recommend things that are relevant to the user based on the user’s information, including what they previously viewed or searched for in order to captivate their interest. Ads can be aimed at a person based on a search they made the previous day. Streaming services recommend alternative shows/movies based on the user’s prior watch history to intrigue users enough to pay for another monthly subscription.</p>

	  <h1>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="classes-col">
	      <h3 class="paraheader"><em>What Is A Recommendation Algorithm?</em></h3>
	      <p>A recommendation algorithm is an algorithm, a precise sequence of instructions to solve some problem, specifically designed to feed content relevant to an individual user. Recommendation algorithms act with the sole intention of narrowing down and predicting what users are interested in. They aim to increase user interaction and keep users engaged in a product. Using information like previous likes and dislikes, recent searches, and interactions, recommendation algorithms strive to keep consumers absorbed in the platform’s product.
	      </p>
	      <h3 class="paraheader"><em>How Does It Work?</em></h3>
	      <p>Recommendation algorithms provide each user with a personalized experience, specifically catered to that individual, being trained to understand user preferences with data gathered from interactions on the platform. Things searches, clicks, likes and dislikes, purchase history, etc., develop the capability to predict user interests on a very personalized level, thus compelling users to continue using the site.</p>
	      <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Examples</em></h3>
	      <p>Social Media sites such as TikTok and Pinterest, actively use recommendation algorithms to feed users posts they may find intriguing, keeping users glued to the app. Watching a video or viewing a post can increase the amount of posts users will see on subjects relating to that post. Even more so when individuals like or save that post. With the rising number of social media users, platforms are increasingly using their users’ data, developing an experience designated for that specific individual. This increases the amount of time spent on social media leaving users addicted to consuming more.

	  <h1>The Feedback Loop</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="classes-col">
	      <h3 class="paraheader"><em>What Are Feedback Loops?</em></h3>
	      <p>Feedback loops are a way of collecting consumer data and deriving content specialized for the person. The more the user interacts with different content, the better informed the algorithm is of the user’s preferences. Based on how the user responds to various content, the more the algorithm learns and corrects the user's personalized page. If an individual watches or likes several videos on a specific subject, the algorithm will most likely recommend or show more related videos as the user interacts more with this specific topic. However, if they skip or dislike a video, the algorithm recognizes this and provides less content on the undesired subject. Sometimes, especially with politically inclined subjects, the more someone interacts with content, the more focused and even biased the content will become. Feeding the individual with more biased or radical forms of content.

	  <h1>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="classes-col">
	      <p>As the range of content narrows with the increased accuracy of content the algorithm feeds a user, radical forms of content, such as conspiracy theories, can engage users. Because the goal of recommendation algorithms is to increase engagement time, they prioritize content that would cause viewers to be highly captivated, including conspiracy theories. With this, algorithms amplify the number of conspiracy videos and heavily push to recommend them to viewers in order to gain as much interaction as possible, ignoring the harm of the content.

	  <h1>Platform Incentives</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="classes-col">
	      <p>The leading incentive for the multitude of platforms to use these recommendation algorithms is primarily for the increase in revenue. Since these recommendation algorithms push this type of engaging conspiracy content more and more, the main benefactors are the companies and content creators. Both gain from the increased engagement among viewers in revenue and popularity. Ads are another way these corporations make money with recommendation algorithms. By feeding individuals ads specifically catering to their specific interests, a person is more likely to interact with the ad or even purchase something from it. In the end, the main source of incentives for these platforms is the revenue accumulated.

	  <h1>Potential For Exploitation</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="classes-col">
	      <p>Although these algorithms can be useful, especially for companies or content creators, they can also be used with the malicious intent to deceive consumers. Although many platforms have guidelines on what creators can post, oftentimes content creators work around them using clickbait such as deceptive thumbnails or engaging titles to boost engagement on posts. In relation to conspiracy theories, algorithms can promote highly engaging content, including misleading conspiracy videos, which boosts content feeding into conspiracy theories and other damaging content as well. Nowadays, it’s very easy to manipulate and spread misinformation, many do it to boost engagement on their platform for increased revenue and growth of their profile. This can be very easy to exploit and lead to many people being misconstrued.
