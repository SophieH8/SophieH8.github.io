      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hii my name is Sophie woo. I have an older brother named Jeremie and a dog named Bonnie. I have played soccer since I was five, and I played on the high school team in ninth grade, it was boring. I have also played piano since I was like really young, and I am pretty good at it. I am also decent at art and am currently in ap art this year. Some clubs I was a part of include hosa, nhs, hopefully national art society this year. I am also the co-president of gwc with Jana :). I like to read sometimes, and I am like sometimes smart sometimes not. I hate tomatoes and olives and other things things, but I like eating good things. This year my classes include cs 2, ap art, adv physics, gt english, ap stats, apush, and adv pre-calc. idk what else to say. Yay
