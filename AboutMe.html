      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi my name is Sophie Hews. I have an older brother named Jeremie and a dog named Bonnie. I have played soccer since I was five, and I played on the high school team in ninth grade, it was boring. I have also played piano since I was like really young, and I am pretty good at it. I am also sometimes really good at art and am currently in ap art this year. Some clubs I was a part of include hosa, national honor society (NHS), national art honor society (NAHS). I am also the co-president of gwc with Jana :). I like to read sometimes, and I am like sometimes smart sometimes not. I hate tomatoes and olives and other things things, but I like eating good things. This year my classes include cs 2, ap art, adv physics, gt english, ap stats, apush, and adv pre-calc. I am very good at math, so I'm good at algerbra, pre-calc (so far), physics, and stats; therefore, I help tutor some of my friends and their siblings in math. idk what else to say. Yay
