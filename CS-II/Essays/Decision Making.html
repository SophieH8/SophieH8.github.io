	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Introduction</em></h3>
	    <p>A bias, defined as “an inclination of temperament or outlook”, is a personal tendency or prejudice towards or against a particular subject (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). It is a feeling that can produce unreasonable judgment in a person or group of people that causes them to act a certain way. Due to personal experiences and influences, people constantly form biases towards or against certain subjects. Thus negatively or positively affecting one’s “course of action” on specific day-to-day actions and problems (Loohuis, 2020). Over the course of the ISP, the team will have many major and minor decisions that will impact the final outcome of the project, thus, it is important to keep an open mind and not let any biases affect the final result of the ISP.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Complexity Bias</em></h3>
	    <p>The complexity bias is a bias in which certain “environmental factors” like “time pressure” and “task stress” can increase the “perceived complexity” of a given task (Arnott, 1998). Given the amount of complex tasks and continuous addition of new ideas, we are likely to have this bias during the course of our project. Having a large team in which everyone contributes to the jutting out of ideas, in addition to the large amount of skills we will be required to learn to complete a successful project, our team is likely to undergo a lot of stress. This combined with the time limit will most likely make our ISP harder than it needs to be, especially since a large team is harder to discuss and come to agreement about certain ideas. However, overcoming this bias shouldn’t be too difficult if we deal with it early on. Splitting into groups and having each group focus on a certain aspect of the ISP should help a lot because smaller teams are easier to work with. Also , instead of learning new skills to help on the entire project, each group only needs to learn a specific set of skills for that certain aspect. By focusing each group on a specific feature of the ISP, we will be able to overcome the “stress”, “time pressure”, and  “perceived importance” of different parts that come with complexity bias (Arnott, 1998).</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Control Bias</em></h3>
	    <p>Control Bias describes the tendency for a person to “overestimate their ability to control or influence” (Zeder, 2021). It arises when someone gains an accomplishment and has a “false feeling of control” over a group or situation (Arnott, 1998). This could arise in our ISP group because someone who may consider themselves as better or smarter than them may gain a feeling of superiority and decide themselves as the ‘leader’ of our team. This feeling of dominance would most likely create rifts in the team, as it is “important” for everyone to have some “feeling of … control” over the project, and if only one person has the ability to make decisions over the entire project, the “outcome can be disastrous” (Arnot, 1998). To prevent this from happening, we will have to set up some sort of agreement or voting system where the majority of the votes will decide the fate of the project. Either this or have everyone agree on a new or edited idea. I don’t believe this control bias will be a problem in the team because so far they seem very easy to work with. By having separate teams work on and manage different sections of the project, as well as by having team votes, the problem of control bias and superior people should be eliminated.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Desire Bias</em></h3>
	    <p>Desire Bias could be a very likely conflict during the completion of our ISP because our “desired outcomes” may very likely be “greater than [the actual] warrants” (Arnott, 1998). This bias arises from the “wishful thinking” and the overestimation of the perceived outcome by the decision maker compared to the actual outcome (Arnott, 1998). This bias could cause very negative outlooks on the final event and cause the decision makers to rethink their capabilities and lower confidence. This desired bias could also be very probable during the duration of our project because of the amount of ideas we want to add to our ISP. Our group may very well be thinking too far outside the box and too ambitious for the allotted time. Also, because of the new skills we have to learn to achieve our end result, desire bias could be a very likely situation. In order to control this bias, our group may have to rethink our plan and go a little less ambitious in our goals. We should also have a timeline in which we want to reach different goals, so that if we get stuck, we can move on and come back to it later without wasting time.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Escalation Bias</em></h3>
	    <p>Escalation bias is the “escalation of commitment” to previously failed events, causing “wasted time” and poor management of the situation (Study.com, 2022). This inability to accept failure and move on causes poor time management, and instead, “rational decisions” should be focusing on “future possibilities and probabilities”, using prior mistakes to learn and alter the experiment (Arnott, 1998). Escalation is usually caused by a desire to “overcome active opposition” or “social pressure” and is more likely to occur when the thinker believes that they are “close to the attainment of a goal” (Arnott, 1998). With all of the ambitions in our ISP, escalation bias could very well occur, especially if we spend time learning new materials/skills, then have to apply them correctly. Learning the skills and then applying them correctly may take more than the allocated time on our timelines/calendars. Therefore to try and overcome this bias, we must plan ahead and possibly make room for learning the skills necessary. By doing this, we ensure that we have enough time to learn and apply our new knowledge in our project without affecting our time and morale.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Confirmation Bias</em></h3>
	    <p>The confirmation bias is when decision makers “seek confirmatory evidence” to persuade themselves that they are correct, while excluding “disconfirming evidence” (Arnott, 1998). Confirmation bias leaves out valuable information, leaving the decision maker to keep a narrow point of view even though this is often unintentional because human “decision making” and “information processing” is often bias because people are “limited to interpreting information from their own viewpoint” (Casad, 2022). This bias could affect our team because we are doing a research-minded project, in which we must gather a load of information and research to place on our website. Confirmation bias would be a very bad consequence if included in our project because we shouldn’t provide any narrow-minded or biased research information otherwise we would be advertising untrue information and influencing people negatively. To avoid confirmation bias, the best thing would be to keep an open mind and take data from multiple sources, with multiple different opinions, in order to let viewers come to decisions without being influenced.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Conclusion</em></h3>
	    <p>During the course of the ISP, our group will have to face several unpredictable biases that may negatively impact our project. Although nothing much can be done to completely eradicate biases, through the use of planning, keeping an open mind, and identifying potential biases, it is possible to avoid them and give our team the best chance of success.</p>
