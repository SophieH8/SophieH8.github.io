	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Introduction</em></h3>
	    <p>Artificial Intelligence, otherwise known as AI, is a branch of Computer Science that has the long-term goal of creating computers that can outperform humans in almost every cognitive task. While we normally think of AI as evil robots from science fiction movies who try and eradicate humans, AI can be encompass anything from "text editors to social media to self-driving cars" ("Examples", n.d.). As AI has grown and improved through the decades, it has impacted life in the work place, making jobs more efficient. However, while AI has many benefits in the near term, we don’t know what will happen as AI continues to improve and potentially become sentient.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Advantages To AI</em></h3>
	    <p>Even though there are countless advantages to using AI in the workplace, one potential downside could be that it results in "significant unemployment" (Quader, 2019). The need for people to operate machines will vanish once AI matches human intelligence. Also, because machinery doesn’t need to take any breaks or vacations, it will become more "advantageous for industries to use" (Quader, 2019).</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Disadvantages To AI</em></h3>
	    <p>In the bigger picture, how can AI be potentially dangerous? As AI intelligence increases, their autonomy increases as well. While I was doing research, I came across weapons called "autonomous weapons" ("Front", 2017). The are weapons systems that use AI to "identify and kill" mainly human targets "without the need of a human" to help them ("Front", 2017). In the hands of the wrond person, this could lead to many casualties, and if the AI becomes capable of making decisions for itself, it could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p>
	    <h3 class="paraheader"><em>Conclusion</em></h3>
	    <p>This brings up the question, if AI ever becomes truly sentient, what other things could they replace humans for? Personally, I do not believe that AI can ever fully become sentient, in my opinion, the ability we have to be fully conscious and capable of feeling, is what makes us humans.</p>
