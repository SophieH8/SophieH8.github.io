      <h1>The Plan...</h1>

      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Identity</h3>
	  <p>Our product, Foob, is a website designed for people to enter in ingredients they have laying around their house, in order to get back many different recipes they can make with the food already in their pantries.</p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Problem</h3>
	  <p>Many times, parents who work have little to no time to cook for their kids and potentially have to go out and buy either fast food our ingredients to cook. Also, many people have a hard time deciding what they should cook for dinner, and often have to go out and buy the ingredients for a recipe they found online. This wastes time as people not only have to look for a recipe, but also go out to buy the ingredients. This is a very inefficient way of preparing a meal and takes away too mcuh time that you could've spent at home. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Solution</h3>
	  <p>Our website allows people to checkmark the ingredients they have at their homes, and gives back recipes they can make with the ingredients listed. Therefore people can enjoy a nice delicious dinner without having to go out and gather many different ingredients beforehand.</p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Target Market</h3>
	  <p>The target audience is anyone who cooks, specifically those who have trouble deciding what to make.</p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Competition</h3>
	  <p>Currently, there are a few applications similar to our idea; however, the most similar one is an app and requires people to download it, which it may not be availible for everyone to download. Because our idea is a website, it is much easier for people to use it. Some applications similar to our ideas already exist, such as the app Supercook, which you can download on the playstore, and the website Recipeland, but you can only select 1 ingredient.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Revenue Streams</h3>
	  <p>Because our idea is a website, our revenue will be generated mainly by online ads, or ads in food magazines. Another potential revenue could be fundraisers, in which we would raise money to improve our websites and create ads of our own.</p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Marketing Activities</h3>
	  <p>We could communicate our service to the target market by creating social media accounts, such as instagram and/or tiktok, to gain a following and let them know about our services. We could also hang posters in various places, maybe even the school, to spread the word even more. The most useful marketing is to create ads for our website; however, this is something in which we will need a revenue for.</p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="classes-col">
	  <h3>Expenses</h3>
	  <p>I don't think we will have that much, if any, expenses, because we are making a website and not using materials to build anything. If we are not making the website with codermerlin, then we will need somewhere to run our website on. We could potentialy get a domain name, which would cost money. We could also potentially have ads for our website, which we will have to generate money for thei expense also.</p>

	  <h3>Team and Key Roles</h3>
	  <p>So far, this project consists of three people. To ensure efficiency in this project, we will need a group of people with a variety of skills to help with the application. We will need artistic people or graphic designers, toe design the pages and make them aesthetically pleasing. We will also need people to research and find a bunch of different recipes and list their ingredients, so that we can create lists of all of the ingredients and recipes possible. We will also need people to program the pages of the website. If possible, we could potentially have a marketing person/group to handle social media accounts and potentially ads.</p>

	  <h3>Milestones</h3>
	  <p>During the second quarter, we are planning to mainly focused on getting everything set up, such as all of the recipes and their ingredients. We hope to compile all of the ingredients and recipe lists by week 7, which is in the middle of December. During the third quarter is when we will begin the coding portion, which we may also do soe during the second qquarterif we have time. After we prepare all the neccessary files, it is predicted that we will start the UI code on week 10 and the home page, and other pages, the week after. The third quater will be mainly coding everything and will probably be the hardest part. During the fourth quarter will be our finalizations, in which we will get all of the code to work and improve it if need be. We hope to make most of the website work by the seventeenth week, which is in march. so that we can focus the rest of our time on improvements and testing the UI to make sure everything will work. Also, we will start and finish our ISP presentation at the end of this quarter.</p>
