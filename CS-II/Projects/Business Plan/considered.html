	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Automated Garden</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> The idea for my ISP is an automated garden, taking multiple environmental factors into account such as sunlight, humidity, etc. and automatically adjusting to always provide and optimal environment for the plants to grow. A Raspberry Pi will be used as the main computer in our ISP, using weather APIs and various sensors to determine the environmental conditions of the garden. The Raspberry Pi will then adjust (e.g., more artifical light in the absence of sunlight, more water pumped into the plants in absence of humidity, etc.) and allow for the plants to thrive.</p>

	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> This project was actually my favorite idea out of all of them because seemed plausible and fun at the same time; however, it would have pushed me because I would have to learn how to use the raspberry pi, as well as, learn some other hardware to complete this project. In fact, I actually have most of the supplies at my house because of my dad, who I would’ve been able to ask if I ever needed help on this project because he is an engineer. Therefore, we wouldn’t really have to buy that much stuff. However, I ultimately decided to reject this proposal because I don’t know the people in the group. Although this sounds like a childish notion, I wouldn’t want to be stuck on a project the whole year not only with people who weren’t in my class but also with people I didn’t know in general.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jana-daouk/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">TheFit</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> Our product is the perfect solution for when one wants to change their style, is late that morning, or simply has no clue what to wear. Our fancy outfit generator, "TheFit", will provide our user with the perfect outfit depending on the occasion, their body type, skin tone, current trends, and preferences of modesty. It will also reccommend similar clothing items that are found in the user's virtual closet. </p>
	  
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> Ultimately, I considered this idea mainly because it seemed very useful and something that I would use. I love the idea of the clothes being chosen based on body type, skin tone, trends, and preferences. However, I chose to reject this idea because multiple people came up with similar ideas to this, also something similar most likely already exists.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mehak-jay/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Therapist Chatbot</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> Our project is a graphically designed character based chatbot that serves specifically as a therapist (communicating both audibly and by text). Designed to help users(clients) get back to feeling like themselves. With tons of clinical research and powerd by AI, unlike the chatbots seen in most websites, this will be intuitive and engaging in conversation extended beyond simple answers to offer intent-based responses. </p>

	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> I thought this was a pretty unique idea; however, my question is how will they get the authenticity of a real therapist by just using a chatbot. I feel as though it won't correctly give the correct feedback for people's personal problems and isn't qualified to do so either. If they do get it to execute well, than I think that this idea is very amazing and especially useful for people who can't afford in-person therapy or those that aren't yet ready to talk about their problems to a real person. Although I originally rejected this idea, our teams agreed to merge into one and form a new idea with both this chatbot and the unIQue proposals, which I think was a great idea. It further adds to both propasals.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zoe-yau/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Available Tables</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> For our ISP, we wanted to create something that could be beneficial to everyone. With our app, Avaliable Tables, you can book a table in any restaurant digitally, without having to make a phone call. This makes the process of making a reservation super simple and efficient. Furthermore, by having an app to digitally make reservations, it minimizes the anxiety people feel when making phone calls.</p>
	  
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> Although this idea sounds good in theory, restuarants will constantly have to check their tables to mark which ones are and arent available, which can be very tedious. Whereas, just standing at a phone waiting for reservations is a lot less effort. Also, phone reservations were made to be not only more convenient but also help with this anxiety problem. Because of this, I ultimately rejected this proposal because I fell as though there is no true need for thier product.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/soohan-cho/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Goose Simulator</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> Our game: Goose Simulator: Your Everyday Average Goose Game is similar to other games such as Deeeer Simulator and The Untitled Goose Game, with varying aspects. This game will have various things for the player to do in-game, like running around and destroying stuff, as well as resident AI that might be unhappy about your rampage. Another feature of the game is online multiplayer. You can either choose to fight or collaborate with the other players. Our game will be on Roblox, where it is free and accessible to anyone, with in-app purchases to make some revenue.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> I considered this idea because creating a game sounds really fun, especially on Roblox, which is my favorite childhood game. I actually tried creating a game on Roblox before, but I ultimately gave up because I didn’t know what I was doing. Now however, I actually have knowledge in coding which would help a lot if I went through with this idea. But I decided not to do it because it didn’t appear to be that challenging unless they made the game very detailed and advanced, which I guess would be possible, especially with the amount of time we are given.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">ShelterSafe</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> As our world changes due to climate change, natural disaster poses a far greater threat than anytime in the past. ShelterSafe aims to eliminate the problem of lack of awareness regarding shelters by prociding a hub that uses GPS signal to locate the user, and then uses cellular data to convey statistics from each nearby shelter concerning food supply, available space, and distance from each shelter. Administrator accounts will be given to non-profits and governments, who can then edit data. Citizens will only have read permissions.</p>
	  
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> This proposal is actually a very good idea and very useful to the average citizen in everyday life. It takes a real current world problem and proposes a pretty well though out solution. However, it relies on the people having the certain app to relay the shelter information, but not everyone will have/get the app or have a device to get the app on. The problem with it is that it seems very complicated to make and actually achieving this goal seems really unrealistic, especially with the time constraint we are given. Therefore, I ultimately rejected this proposal because it seems unachievable given the time alotted.</p>

	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> My isp is to design a pair of electric rollerblades with custom VESC based firmware and a software differential.</p>
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> This idea actually seems like a really cool idea, and if it is actually done, I can't wait to see it completed. I considered this idea because it sounded really fun and was very creative compared to many of the other ideas because their was nothing like it. However, I ultimately rejected this proposal because I would not be able to be of assistance in any way, and I also don't really understand what they are trying to make.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/benjamin-haines/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">City Planner</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> Our app, the City Planner, is a community-organization service. It has community leaders create event planning sheets. It was created mostly due to the lack of togetherness that most cities and towns suffer from. Users can filter and select city events that want to atttend, abd get notified when it is about to begin.</p>
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> I considered this idea because it seems pretty useful and actually possible to do. However, although this app seems like a good idea, many cities already have a similar idea implemented, but in website form. Because many cities already have websites which have calenders that describe events, as well as, go further and have service oportunities and other things, this app would be considered a downgrade to that. Therefore, there is really no point in the creation of this app when similar and better city event planners already exist on the internet.</p>

	  <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shivanshi-das/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Eagle Eats</a></h3>
	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> Our idea is to create an application so that you can preorder your lunch so that students spend less time waiting in lines. When your food is ready, you will get a notification with an order number that you can show to the staff member at the pickup line and get your food faster. You can order your lunch before lunch even starts so that it will be ready shortly after lunch begins.</p>
	  <p><u>Reason Of Consideration and Rejection:</u> This idea is actually good and very useful, especially for people who buy their lunches. I know from personal experience that the lines take forever and give you no time to eat. It would be much better during that time if you were able to sit down and talk until your food is ready. However, I rejected it because I'm not sure if it would be that efficient because I feel like there would be many issues and it would be difficult to actually put to use. The lunch people would be completely overloaded with orders every lunch period instead of recieving one order at a time, which would be very stressful to them. My question is do you pay on the app or scan your card when your food is ready.</p>

	      	  <p><u>Summary of Project:</u> Our product is an online webpage that specilaizes in brain health. Uses of the website will include, games to raise IQ, scientific practices to increase brain health, and tips to take care of your brain. The revenue will come through approved advertisments on the websites, and donations through users.</p>

	      <p><u>Reason Of Acception:</u> At the beginning, I thought this idea was really basic and pretty mundane, as it was just building a website with games and other activities on it. However, while talking with other groups, we ultimately came up with the decision to combine groups with the therapist chatbot because mental health relates to this website. Now that I have decided to join this group, I can actually see this idea expanding and developing over time to combine with more complicated ideas and become a complete project. I can see this project going in many different directions and the idea is still pretty vague, which leaves a lot of room for new ideas.</p>
