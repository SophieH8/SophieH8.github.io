		    <p><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-unIQue/issues/76">My top priority this week is that I will attempt to design the help Tree's shared css file so that all of the help tree wiki's look good and cohesive.</a></p>
		    <p><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-unIQue/issues/79">If I am able to design the help tree, I will continue to add a navigation bar to all parts of the website and make it navigable.</a></p>

		    <p>I designed the CSS page of all of the shared wikis for the Help Tree. I didn't push my changes yet, as I am not completely finished. I would like to change the colors up a bit. Navigation Bars should already be on the actual help tree wikis.</p>
		    		    <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, I had many scheduling challenges, mainly because AP exams were this week and I had to focus on studying instead of the ISP. I didn't really have time, therefore I didn't fully finish the designing of the help tree wikis, however, I did most of it. I created a title screen, as well as seperated the paragraphs into sections when scrolling down. I just now have to find time over the weekend to finish the designing, but since I have AP exams next week, this will be very challenging. I will just have to try my best to manage my time.</p>
		    <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		    <p>I didn't really have any technical challenges this week, besides trying to implement more CSS animation of our website, specifically in the title pages of our help tree wikis. I found some tutorials and watched them and altered their code to fit our website better. I am learning a lot more about CSS with this project, specifically using CSS to animate.</p>

		    <p>I came up with a design for the help tree page, but it is pretty ambitious. I began to design helpTree page as well as the branches of the helpTree.</p>
		    <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		    <p>This week, I had a few technical challenges when placing the navigation bar on some of the pages, like the white sound page. For some reason, the navigation bar didn't fit the page and extended out of it. This didn't happen on the other pages, so I decided not to add the navigation bar on that page for now and I will try it again later. Also. I did have trouble deciding how I would design the help tree and it's pages. I have just come up with an idea and am starting to complete it now. I will probably try to finish it next week.</p>
		    <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>At the beginning of the week, I set pretty ambitious goals knowing I probaly wouldn't finish all of them, and I didn't. However, I did start on every goal, I just didn't complete all of them. I should get finished next week, however, I have AP testing next week and will probably be very busy. But I will try to get as much done as possible.</p>

	      <h3>Challenges<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, I actualy did quite a bit, including finishing the sliding puzzle that I started last week. I had quite a few problems whil making it though, because I don't really know Javascript that much. I missed typed a bunch of things, which led to my game not working and me trying to figure out what I had done wrong. However, I believe I have fixed most if it, because it now works on the version I tested in my personal directory. Since I have completed one version of this game, it should be much easier now to create harder versions, like 5x5 and picture puzzles. I hope to start working on those on the weekend. I think I did a good job of overcoming the challenges this week, and hope to continue to learn Javascript so that I can avoid having these similar problems in the future.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I think we progressed a lot as a group this week, especially since I finished another game. Now that we have more games, all we have to do is fix the designing of the website, so that it looks like one cohesive website, instead of a bunch of random webpages linked together. Not only have we done a lot of work on the game, but some of our group members are progressing a lot on other things too, such as the help tree. After taking a look at the help tree, I think it looks pretty good so far. We just have to add a little more stuff and fix the design and the help tree should be pratically finished. I think we didn't have any scheduling issues this week, and hope that our ISP can continue to progress this smoothly.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>Once again, I think we lacked communication. Although we communicate via discord quite a lot, especially to track who's working on which branch and such, I find we lack any communication out side of tracking work. Right now, I don't really have any idea on what is going on with the other parts of our website. For example, I don't really know what our group is doing with the help tree, or what everyone else is coding. I only know what is going on after the branches are merged and I can view the website when it is up to date. I think we really should have a group discussion in class about what each member should work in, as well as check-in on everyone and how they are doing with the ISP.</p>

	      <h3>Challenges<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week I began adding a new game onto our website. When searching for more puzzle games, I decided to code a sliding puzzle game, in which you get a square with multiple tiles inside and one empty tile. These tiles contain numbers that you move around and re order from 1 to 15.  Because I don't know much JavaScript, the only real technical challenge I had this week was figuring out how to buld the game. To get through this challenge, I watched various tutorials and followed them. By following tutorials, not only will I be able to code the sliding puzzle game, but through coding I will begin to understand and learn more Javascript. I am hoping to get this game finished next week so that I can begin connecting the webpages together and designing them so that they are all similar because as of right now, each page looks v=drastically different.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I think we progressed quite a bit this week, especially with the features on the website. I started really coding the game and I believe some of my other group members also started on a name game, namely the tangrams game. I believe our only scheduling is completing the webite by the deadline. As of right now we only have one game dinished, but still need to better the design for that game and connect it to the rest of the website. The only way to get by this conflict would be to put more effort into the ISP and take more time on it, whether at school or at home.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, I think we lacked on personal communication, although some members did talk amongst themselves, there wasn't much group discussion. I think this has been a challenge plaguing us recently, and I'm not sure if it is because of having a lot of work in other classes or scheduling, but hopefully we can overcome this challenge by communicating more. I think if we start using discord to set up meetings or some meetings in class, we could better our communication and our plan for our ISP moving forward.</p>

	      <h3>Challenges<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week I designed the home page. After finding a bunch of inspiration through searching and research of Parallax websites, I finally decided how I was going to do the home page. I firstly went to a free online digital art website and drew the different layers of my home page. Then by watching a few parallax scrolling tutorials I designed the page using the backgrounds I just drew. I also fixed the navigation bar/tabs to make them prettier. I didn't really have much technical challenges with this as there were many different tutorials to help me understand along the way. I did get stuck a few times, but soon figured it out.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I think we progressed quite a bit this week, especially with the design of the website. However since scheduling was this week and everyone was worried about that, I'm not sure how the other members did, but I'm sure they did something too. I think if we progress like this in the future, we could finished our ISP faster and will not have as many scheduling issues. The only way to get by this conflict would be to put more effort into the ISP and take more time on it, whether at school or at home.</p>

	      <h3>Challenges<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week I mainly focused on the new mission, and infact, I almost finished it; I just have to add the other l-systems. I also did a little more planning for the ISP, such as researching different websites and taking inspiration off of those. Besides some little challenges I had on the mission, I didn't have many challenges on the ISP besides deciding how I am going to design the website. Through my research, I have found Parallax scrolling websites, so I think I may want to add some of that to the website. However, websites like that require some javascript, so I will have to overcome that barrier and learn a little javascript by watching different tutorials. Hopefully next week, I will have finished designing the home page using parallax scrolling and start working on the other pages.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I would say that this week our group didn't progress too much, besides finally linking all of the pages together. I think most of us were finishing/starting the missions and therefore didn't really do much on the ISP. Also, I don't really remember when our ISP is due, but if it is due in April then we better start working more because we aren't really anywhere near finished. I think that with our other classes we haven't been able to get much done out of school so our ISP is still in it's beginning stages. I think if we were all to start working more on it and spare some time at home to work on it then we could start getting more work done.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I don't really think there were any interpersonal challenges this week, however since one of our group members is in a different class, I don't think our group has had that much contact with them, whether through discord or in real life. I don't really know what he is currently working on in the ISP either. I think the only way to resolve this is through communication like always. I think that we have slightly slowed down on our group communication and we don't really talk together much as a whole anymore. This could be partially due to stress in school with scheduling coming up, but hopefully we can start to communicate more and get past this.</p>

		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, I mainly focused on planning out the webpage more and looking at inspiration online for the formatting of the website. By mainly doing this instead of actually coding, I feel like we have planned the website out more and have a better idea of how we are going to continue with this project. I have decided now how the website home page and other pages will be formatted, so now we just have to start to actually code and desing the webpages. </p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week our group progressed a lot, especially with each individual starting to add more to the webpages. For example, some group members started the recipe portion of our website, and did a very good job on it. I believe that since now we have a better idea of what we are doing, we can make more progression in our project, as long as we continue working on it. I plan to personally start doing a better job on designing the website now that I have a design in mind. With each group member starting to progress more in the ISP, I believe that we should not have that many scheduling challenges unless we come to a problem.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>Just like last week, there weren't really any interpersonal challenges. Each member of our group is starting to do more work, making our pregress more efficient. We also even did our MVP presentation, which we all worked on, I designed the slides, and the rest of the members added all the necessary information. Also, all group members who were present in our class did the presentation together, each of us speaking an equal amount, which I think really shows how well our group is working together. Again like I keep saying the previous weeks, if we ever come to an interpersonal challenge, we really just need to communicate, whether it be on discord or in person.</p>

		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, we really started to do more planning and started to actually develop the webpage. Through doing so, I personally came across many challenges this week. Since my main job is the code in html and css to design the website, I realized that I wasn't able to see my edits even after I refreshed the link. Therefore, I had to do all of the coding on an alternate website, liveweave.com, and then copy and paste my edits to our actual file. This way is very inefficient and very hard to see what the website actually looks like until someone merges the branches together. Because of this conflict, I didn't get as much as I would have like to do on the homepage, but at least I have a base, with color as well. Now that I know about the issue, I feel like although annoying, it will be much easier to progressive forward once I get used to it. By communicating more with my team and resolving this issue using liveweave, I think I can overcome this conflict, although, it will still be inefficient. Hopefully we can find another way to get around this problem.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week our group progressed a lot more than usually because we had to focus both on the ISP MVP as well as the ISP checkup; therefore, our team worked mainly on the ISP this week and learning how to use github in our project. There weren't many scheduling challenges besides tehcnical challenges that prevented further porgression of the ISP, but those were solved pretty quickly. However, although they were solved quickly, they did inhibit our ISP, and we didn't get as much done as I believe we could've this week. Now that we are passed these challenges, we can continue to move forward, and hopefully be able to get more done in the following weeks.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I don't think there were any interspersonal challenges this week. We actually collaborated pretty well as a team, communicating and setting up decently long meetings on discord. There, we discussed our plans and also collaborated on certain issues we were having at the moment, whether it be merging branches, or the conflict with viewing the html page. By communicating well this week, I believe we managed to alleviate most interpersonal issues. By continueing good communication methods, as well as hopefully working together more during classtime, I believe that our team can continue to get past any interpsersonal challenges purely through communitcating.</p>

		  <p>This week, I was focused on W2511 and learning about Lindenmayer Systems, what it is and what its uses are. However, I kind of understand Lindenmayer Systems, not really well, I don't really understand what you can use it for. I also dont really understand what we are doing with W2511 and the mission just assigned to us. I was collarborating with some peers, and therefore I was able to do some of it, but I realy don't understand what is going on. The only way to solve this is truly by researching more about it, and also attempting to do parts of the mission.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, each individual in our team was more focused on learning about L-Systems and therefore we didn't do much on the ISP. I believe that some of our group have started working on certain aspects of our ISP, but the rest of us haven't done much. To speed up the process when our group really starts focusing on the ISP, a few of us have started researching and learning Java on the side.  I think that because we were given a mission and told to learn about L-Systems and W2511, we weren't really focused on the ISP and therefore didn't do much work. The only way to get past this problem is to try and do the work in advanced so we can later focus on our ISP, or we can set up certain days of the week to focus on our ISP and spend the other days doing classwork.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>Again this week we didn't realy have any interpersonal challenges aside from everyone working on their own thing. Some of us were working on W2511 and L-Systems, while others did a little ISP. Since we weren't all focused on the ISP, I don't believe we got much work done on it. Since we are al focusing on different things, I'd say the best thing could be, as I said above, set aside certain days for ISP and other days for class work. By doing this, we could collaborate better and have more effiency when working.</p>

		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, I was mainly focused on learning more about SQL to prepare for the upcoming quiz; therefore, I didn't do much if any ISP work. I am starting to get SQL a little more, but I am not very good at it yet. Also, I don't have very good notes. To combat this, I will need to study and mae sure to take good notes over what I study so that I will have useful information to be on the test day.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, the only challenge was finding time to do ISP work instead of studying SQL. Most of our team member were studying for the quiz so we didn't really make any time for our ISP. Although, we did plan a little bit at one point during the week. I think that if we continue getting extra work and quizses during the upcoming weeks, it will be hard for us to balance out between that and our ISP. There isn't really much we can do to solve this, as we do not make the schedules; however, maybe we could get our work done at the beginning of the week so that we can use the end of the week for our ISP.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I don't really believe we had any interperonal challenges this week. Our chatbot group starting working on a plan for the chatbot with a flowchart, and I watched them and also provided some input. Therefore, we didn't really have any challenges, in fact, quite the opposite as we actually did a little of our ISP. I guess one continuous challenge is our limited abiliy to really contact our other group member in a different class.  believe that this will be the main interpersonal challenge that will take up the course of our ISP because it is hard to plan things when not in person. We could solve this by staging little meet ups where we can meet up and work on our ISP.</p>

	      <h3>Challenges<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week, our group didn't really spend much time working on the ISP, instead we focused mainly on learning and understanding SQL. Because of the fact that we have a quiz next week we mainly focused on learning about SQL, therefore the main challenge was just understanding how SQL works. Because I missed a day during a lecture, I had a harder time grasping the concept and understanding what the language is used for. However, I can overcom this my doing a lot of research on SQL as well as practicing with SQL.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>This week there weren't many if any scheduling challenges. I guess the biggest challenge with scheduling this week was because it was a short week, and therefore, we didn't have as much time to work on assignments as we normally would. I think in the future as we begin to work on our ISP, we should set up a schedule, keeping in mind breaks and short weeks, so that we can have better efficiency.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>I don't really believe we had any interperonal challenges this week. I think the worst interpersonal challenge was thatthere wasn't a single day where our entire group was here. Each day, one or more people were missing from class. I think that in the future when we start diving deeper into our ISP we can combat this challenge by communicating about when we will be absent and letting the rest of our team members know as soon as possible. By doing this, we can switch roles when needed and manage our project more efficiently.</p>

	      <h3>Challenges<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Technical Challenges</h4>
		  <p>Due to the fact that we have not started coding our project yet, we didn't face too many technical issues this week, if any at all. We mainly worked on setting up our GitHub repository and our ISP project board. The only issues we really ran into were some issues using GitHub and the project board, as it was pretty condusing at the beginning. We ended up being able to post all our issues on the project board and managed to overcome this issue. So far we haven't really had any technical issues so far, but I am anticipating that not knowing Java very well will become an issue for us in the future, especially since we will be using it to code many of our features, like the games. To overcome this, we should begin learning Javascript as soon as possible, in order to prevent this conflict from occuring in the future.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Scheduling Challenges</h4>
		  <p>So far, our group hasn't had many scheduling challenges, mostly because we have not yet created a proper and orderly schedule to follow. Therefore, I would say our groups main scheduling challenge is that we don't have a schedule and that we have barely started. However, once we start both of the conflicts are very minor and will be quick and easy fixes. A good way to overcome these problems is to come together as a group and create a rough schedule of what we want to accomplish each week, as well as who will be working on what aspect of the project each week (because we have multiple aspects). Once we do that, we just need to start working, whether it's creating the html and css files, or by learning java. Although these scheduling challenges we have had this week should be easy to overcome, I expect more enduring challenges to come once we really start to dive deep into this project.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
		  <p>Again, we haven't really had that many challenges this week, including interpersonal challenges. Although right now, our main interpersonal challenge in my opinion is the lack of communication. ALthough our group has set up a discord server for us to discuss things as a group, we still really haven't come together to discuss the details of our project. We have a rough plan of what each individual will do during the project, but personally, I fel like we need to have a day where we get together to actually discuss the project in erson so that we are all on the right track and can start. The hardest part of all this is that one of our members is neither in the same class nor period as the rest of us. Therefore, it is harder to include them in our group than the rest of us who share the same class. I believe that we can get over this hurdle by utilizing the discord server more often and efficiently, and thereby communicating better.</p>

	      <h3>Initial Roles<h3>
		  <h4 class="third-header">(Software) Development Engineer</h4>
		  <p>A software or development engineer is an engineer who is responsible for creating or engineering any kind of software. They typicaly work in teams to create programs and applications through the use of various coding languages. I am pretty suitable for this role because I am pretty good and coding and developing, especially in html and css. Therefore, I would be good at the creation of the website, making sure it looks nice too. However, one major challenge for me would be having to learn java. Because we are going to code games and other unique applications on our website, I will have to learn some java to achieve this. My plan to overcome this challenge is just by learning java, mostly via youtube videos, and practicing along with other tutorials.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">QA Engineer</h4>
		  <p>A quality assurance engineer, also know as a QA engineer, is responsible for testing the numerous parts of a product at each phase of development to ensure it complies with standards. To ascertain that there are no issues with the completed product and that everything works properly, QA engineers will perform continuous tests during all developmental stages. In short, a quality assurance engineer oversees every phase of development to verify that the final product meets the correct standard of quality. I have a high personal suitability to this role because I am a perfectionist and would make sure every little detail is up to the highest standard of quality. I am decent at picking out errors and pointing out where something can be improved on. I don't think there would be many challenges with this role except for havingthe general knowledge and understanding about all the code in the project, so that I can test the components with utmost certainty that everything is performing to the best of its ability.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Project Manager</h4>
		  <p>A project manager is the individual who is in overall charge of both the planning and execution of a project. They organize, plan, and execute projects, keeping the team organized and on track. Project managers lead the entire team and define the overall project goal, by overseeing and communicating closely with team members. This role is mainly responsible for the execution of teamwork, they focus mainly on coordinating, managing, and overseeing the project and team. I am less personally suitable for this role because of my bad planning and time management skills. I would much rather have someone else create a plan and I just follow it. Although I would be pretty good at communicating and overseeing the team, I feel as though other member of the team would do a much better job at keeping us organized and on track. As I said before the main challenge I would encounter in this role is my inability to manage our time properly, this would be bad as we would possible have to rush through the final stages of development, leading to a bad final product. My only idea in overcoming this problem would be to get our team together and create a plan at the very beginning, deviating from that plan as little as possible. </p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Product Manager</h4>
		  <p>Whereas the project manager is responsible for coordinating and overseeing the team, a product manager supervises the development of the actual product. They are the main visionaries and are the ones that come up with the creation and vision of a product. They are often the leader of a team because they are needed to provided their expertise to lead and make product decisions. Product managers are responsible for ensuring all new products fulfill consumer needs. My personal suitability to this role is decently high because I like making things neat and aesthetic, and I am most likely going to oversee the graphical design and html/css aspect of this project. However although I am good at designing visualy appealing things, I am not very creative and wouldn't be able to think of additional ideas to add to our product. Also the main visionary in our project isn't me, and I think the job of product manager would be much more suited for a different person. The main challenge that I would expect to encounter is not seeing the main vission of the product and not being able to come up with additional ways to improve it. I would plan to overcome this challenge by including other team members in conversation and asking them for their opinions and ideas.</p>
		  <h4 class="third-header">Release Engineer</h4>
		  <p>Release engineering is a field in software engineering that involves the creation and delivery of software and components. A release engineer is someone who is focused on the mechanics of the development and processing of the software products in a project. Release engineering mainly deals with the accumulation and delivery of source codes into other components. These individuals oversee and regulate the placement and distribution of the source code. My personal suitability to this role is pretty low, mainly because it doesn't seem very interesting to me, and I also don't really understand what release engineering is very well. This role seems pretty similar to the (software) development engineering role except the release engineers are involved in the delivery aspect.The biggest challenge for me in this role is that I wouldn't know what I was doing, especially the releasing/delivering part of this role. I would overcome it by research even deeper into this specific job in order to better understand the role and its duties.</p>
