      <h1>This Portfolio Is Important Because...</h1>

      <div class="row">
	<div class="important-col">
	  <h3>One</h3>
	  <p>Having a digital portfolio showcases a persons's accomplishments and improvement over time. It is a visual representation of skills and growth and highlights the process of learning, while guiding people to become self-directed learners.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="important-col">
	  <h3>Two</h3>
	  <p>While creating this digital portfolio, I've learned a lot about html and css. Before creating this portfolio, I had never used css and I only ever used html on the journals from last year, which weren't really that pretty. However, through watching like ten different 3 hour tutorials and videos teaching about html, css, and how to create websites using them, as well as using the website w3 schools, I have begun to understand both html and css and create my own portfolio. I can actually now understand and code quite a bit in both these languages. Although there is still a lot for me to learn, I know that while I continue working on the portfolio I will continue to learn.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="important-col">
	  <h3>Three</h3>
	  <p>Creating a digital portfolio helps cement important skills people might need for future use. It teaches organization, problem solving, creativity, and digital skills. Some of these skills are very important for future jobs, and will help a person to succeed.</p>
