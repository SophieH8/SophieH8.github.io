	  <h3>Computer Science I</h3>
	  <p>Last years CS class was very fun and I feel like I have learned a lot. I also learned a lot at the beginning of last year about boolean algebra, as well as hexidecimal and octal number systems. To me these were actually fun because I am really good at math. Bitwise operations and logic gates were also fun because I was good at them. I had never had any coding experience prior to this class, yet at the end of the year, I and a group of friends managed to code a game using swift for our ISP. I've learned a lot about coding using swift and now I'm learning more about html and css while making this portfolio. :)</p>
